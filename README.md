# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures using the C programming language. The project is inspired by and serves as a practical complement to the renowned book "Introdução a Estruturas de Dados" (Introduction to Data Structures) by Waldemar Celes, Renato Cerqueira, and José Lucas Rangel. Our goal is to provide clear and functional examples that assist students and developers in understanding and applying these essential computer science concepts.

## About the Book

"Introdução a Estruturas de Dados" is a seminal work in the field of computer science, widely recognized for its didactic and comprehensive approach to the subject. Published by Campus/Elsevier, the book is a valuable reference for anyone seeking to deepen their knowledge of algorithms and data structures. We strongly recommend reading it for a thorough theoretical understanding of the concepts implemented here.

## Repository Structure

Each type of data structure covered in the book will be implemented in a separate directory within the `/src` folder. The organization aims to facilitate navigation and individual study of each structure.

```
. 
├── src/
│   ├── binary-tree/
│   ├── graphs/
│   └── ... (other data structures)
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

## Features

This repository will offer:

- Clear and well-commented implementations of various data structures.
- Usage examples for each structure, demonstrating their basic operations.
- Unit tests (where applicable) to ensure the correctness of implementations.
- Internal documentation to facilitate code understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C (C11 standard or higher)
- **Compiler:** GCC (recommended) or Clang
